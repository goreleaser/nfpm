## Why

While [fpm][] is great, for me, it is a bummer that it depends on `ruby`, `tar`
and other software.

I wanted something that could be used as a binary and/or as a library and that
was really simple.

So I created nFPM: a simpler, 0-dependency, as-little-assumptions-as-possible alternative to fpm.
