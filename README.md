## Why

While [fpm][] is great, for me, it is a bummer that it depends on `ruby`, `tar`
and other software.

I wanted something that could be used as a binary and/or as a library and that
was really simple.

So I created nFPM: a simpler, 0-dependency, as-little-assumptions-as-possible alternative to fpm.

## Usage

Check the documentation at https://nfpm.goreleaser.com

## Special thanks 🙏

Thanks to the [fpm][] authors for fpm, which inspires nfpm a lot.

## Donate

Donations are very much appreciated! You can donate/sponsor on the main
[goreleaser opencollective](https://opencollective.com/goreleaser)! It's
easy and will surely help the developers at least buy some ☕️ or 🍺!
