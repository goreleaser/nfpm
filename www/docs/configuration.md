# Configuration

## Reference

A commented out `nfpm.yaml` config file example:

```yaml
# Name. (required)
name: foo

# Architecture. (required)
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, eg version: ${GOARCH}
# The architecture is specified using Go nomenclature (GOARCH) and translated
# to the platform specific equivalent. In order to manually set the architecture
# to a platform specific value, use deb_arch, rpm_arch and apk_arch.
arch: amd64

# Platform.
# Defaults to `linux`.
platform: linux

# Version. (required)
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, eg version: v${SEMVER}
version: v1.2.3

# Version Schema allows you to specify how to parse the version String.
# Default is `semver`
#   `semver` parse the version string as a valid semver version
#   `none` skip trying to parse the version string and just use what is passed in
version_schema: semver

# Version Epoch.
# Default is extracted from `version` if it is semver compatible.
epoch: 2

# Version Prerelease.
# Default is extracted from `version` if it is semver compatible.
prerelease: beta1

# Version Metadata (previously deb.metadata).
# Default is extracted from `version` if it is semver compatible.
# Setting metadata might interfere with version comparisons depending on the packager.
version_metadata: git

# Version Release.
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, eg release: ${VERSION_RELEASE}
release: 1

# Section.
section: default

# Priority.
# Defaults to `optional` on deb
# Defaults to empty on rpm and apk
priority: extra

# Maintainer.
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, eg maintainer: ${GIT_COMMITTER_NAME} <${GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL}>
# Defaults to empty on rpm and apk
# Leaving the 'maintainer' field unset will not be allowed in a future version
maintainer: Carlos Alexandro Becker <root@carlosbecker.com>

# Description.
# Defaults to `no description given`.
description: Sample package

# Vendor.
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, eg vendor: ${VENDOR}
vendor: GoReleaser

# Contents to add to the package
# This can be binaries or any other files.
contents:
  # Basic file that applies to all packagers
  - src: path/to/local/foo
    dst: /usr/local/bin/foo

  # Simple config file
  - src: path/to/local/foo.conf
    dst: /etc/foo.conf
    type: config

  # Simple symlink at /usr/local/bin/foo which points to /sbin/foo, which is
  # the same behaviour as `ln -s /sbin/foo /usr/local/bin/foo`.
  #
  # This also means that both "src" and "dst" are paths inside the package (or
  # rather paths in the file system where the package will be installed) and
  # not in the build environment. This is different from regular files where
  # "src" is a path in the build environment. However, this convention results
  # in "dst" always being the file that is created when installing the
  # package.
  - src: /actual/path/to/foo
    dst: /usr/bin/foo
    type: symlink

  # Corresponds to `%config(noreplace)` if the packager is rpm, otherwise it is just a config file
  - src: path/to/local/bar.conf
    dst: /etc/bar.conf
    type: config|noreplace

  # These files are not actually present in the package, but the file names
  # are added to the package header. From the RPM directives documentation:
  #
  # "There are times when a file should be owned by the package but not
  # installed - log files and state files are good examples of cases you might
  # desire this to happen."
  #
  # "The way to achieve this, is to use the %ghost directive. By adding this
  # directive to the line containing a file, RPM will know about the ghosted
  # file, but will not add it to the package."
  #
  # For non rpm packages ghost files are ignored at this time.
  - dst: /etc/casper.conf
    type: ghost
  - dst: /var/log/boo.log
    type: ghost

  # You can user the packager field to add files that are unique to a specific packager
  - src: path/to/rpm/file.conf
    dst: /etc/file.conf

  # Sometimes it is important to be able to set the mtime, mode, owner, or group for a file
  # that differs from what is on the local build system at build time. The owner (if different
  # than 'root') has to be always specified manually in 'file_info' as it will not be copied
  # from the 'src' file.
  - src: path/to/foo
    dst: /usr/local/foo
    file_info:
      # Make sure that the mode is specified in octal, e.g. 0644 instead of 644.

  # Using the type 'dir', empty directories can be created. When building RPMs, however, this
  # type has another important purpose: Claiming ownership of that folder. This is important
  # because when upgrading or removing an RPM package, only the directories for which it has
  # claimed ownership are removed. However, you should not claim ownership of a folder that
  # is created by the distro or a dependency of your package.
  # A directory in the build environment can optionally be provided in the 'src' field in
  # order copy mtime and mode from that directory without having to specify it manually.

## Templating

Templating is not and will not be supported.

If you really need it, you can build on top of nFPM, use `envsubst`, `jsonnet`
or apply some other templating on top of it.

## JSON Schema

nFPM also has a [jsonschema][] file which you can use to have better editor support:

```
https://nfpm.goreleaser.com/schema.json
```

You can also generate it for your specific version using the [`nfpm jsonschema`][schema] command.

Note that it is in early stages.
Any help and/or feedback is greatly appreciated!
